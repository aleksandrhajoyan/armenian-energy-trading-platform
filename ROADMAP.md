# Implementation Roadmap

Small, reviewable chunks. High-level **phases are not implementation units** — each phase is split into the chunks below (and further chunks if a slice does not fit a single review).

Checkbox legend: `[x]` done · `[ ]` not started.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] **Chunk 0** — Documentation and repository skeleton (this chunk)
- [x] **Chunk 1** — Python Project Bootstrap, Dependency Management, Typed Configuration, and Minimal Application Health Check
- [x] **Chunk 2** — Canonical Domain Contracts and Value Objects
- [x] **Chunk 3** — Error Contracts, Diagnostics, and Observability Foundation

## Phase 1 — Anti-Corruption Layer

Split into reviewable chunks; do not implement as one drop.

- [x] **Chunk 4** — Adapter Ports and Structured Ingestion Boundary
- [x] **Chunk 5** — Semantic Schema Mapping and Field Resolution Engine
- [x] **Chunk 6** — CSV Structured Ingestion Adapter
- [x] **Chunk 7** — Excel Structured Ingestion Adapter
- [x] **Chunk 8** — Deterministic Consumption Unit and Timezone Normalization
- [x] **Chunk 9** — Duplicate Timestamp Policy and Interval Validation
- [x] **Chunk 10** — Missing-Interval Detection and Gap Reporting
- [x] **Chunk 11** — DLQ Persistence Boundary
- [x] **Chunk 12** — Unstructured Document Extraction Boundary

## Phase 2 — Infrastructure

Split into reviewable chunks. Start services only when a chunk needs them (RAM budget).

- [x] **Chunk 13** — Async PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB Persistence Foundation
- [x] **Chunk 14** — Consumption PostgreSQL Persistence Slice
- [x] **Chunk 15** — PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB Service Profile and Live Persistence Integration
- [x] **Chunk 16** — Application Cache Port Boundary (Redis-free)
- [ ] Concrete Redis infrastructure
- [ ] Qdrant
- [ ] Docker Compose with profiles (remaining services)

## Phase 3 — Application orchestration foundation

- [ ] Agent interfaces (ports)
- [ ] Orchestration state
- [ ] LangGraph skeleton (conceptual flow only until nodes are filled)
- [ ] Retries / fallback policy hooks

## Phase 4 — Ingestion agents

- [ ] Weather & Renewable Forecast Agent
- [ ] Hydro Resources Agent
- [ ] Generation Availability Agent
- [ ] News Intelligence Agent
- [ ] Market Monitoring Agent
- [ ] Parallel Phase 2 join in the orchestrator

## Phase 5 — Regulatory + pricing

- [ ] Regulatory Intelligence Agent (retrieval against Qdrant when ready)
- [ ] Pricing & Sales Agent
- [ ] Contract-phase graph slice

## Phase 6 — ML feature pipelines and forecasting

- [ ] Shared ML utilities (`ml/common`)
- [ ] Load feature pipeline + model training/inference path
- [ ] Price feature pipeline + model training/inference path
- [ ] Consumer Load Forecast Agent (ML-backed)
- [ ] DAM Price Forecast Agent (ML-backed)

## Phase 7 — Risk + trading

- [ ] Portfolio & Risk Agent
- [ ] Trading Strategy Agent
- [ ] Bid canonical persistence

## Phase 8 — Clearing + settlement

- [ ] Market clearing result ingestion (ACL)
- [ ] Billing & Settlement Agent
- [ ] Settlement canonical persistence

## Phase 9 — FastAPI surface

- [ ] `/api/v1` app shell, error envelope, correlation IDs
- [ ] Endpoints as specified in an updated `API_CONTRACTS.md` (currently TBD)

## Phase 10 — End-to-end workflow

- [ ] Chief Orchestrator Agent wiring across all five business phases
- [ ] Fixture-driven DAM day walkthrough (no live vendor APIs required)

## Phase 11 — Evaluation / hardening

- [ ] Architecture tests, DLQ replay, ML backtesting hooks
- [ ] Resource-usage pass for WSL2 8 GB constraint
- [ ] Failure-mode drills (missing source, duplicate hours)

## Phase 12 — Demo / presentation / deployment documentation

- [ ] Compose demo profile documentation
- [ ] Presentation artifacts (`PRESENTATION_NOTES.md`)
- [ ] Deployment notes (production topology still TBD)

## Current pointer

- **Completed:** Chunk 0 through Chunk 16
- **Next:** Next Phase 2 slice to be selected after Chunk 16 publication; concrete Redis infrastructure remains pending.
